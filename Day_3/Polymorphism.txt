Polymorphism :

Types :
Static Polymorphism : method binding is done at compilation time
It can be achieved by using Method overloading

What is Method Overloading?
A method with same name but different signature is called as Method overloading
ex. Calculator
** Signature
    > No of parameters
    > Datatype of parameters
    > Sequence of parameters

Dynamic Polymorphism : method binding is done at execution time
It can be achieved by using Method  overriding 
To implement method overriding Inheritance concept is used.
